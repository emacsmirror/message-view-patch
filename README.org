[[https://melpa.org/#/message-view-patch][file:https://melpa.org/packages/message-view-patch-badge.svg]]

*  message-view-patch

=mu4e= and =gnus= extension to colorize patch-like emails. Based on
[[https://github.com/orgcandman/emacs-plugins/blob/master/gnus-article-treat-patch.el][gnus-article-treat-patch.el]] and adapted to work with =mu4e=. It also continues
to work with =gnus=.

This package was renamed from =mu4e-patch= to =message-view-patch= to reflect
that it works with both =mu4e= and =gnus= (and maybe others?).

* Installation

The package =message-view-patch= may be installed directly from [[https://melpa.org/#/org-ql][MELPA]] or with other tools
like [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]].

After installation, add the hook,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; colorize patch-based emails
(add-hook 'gnus-part-display-hook 'message-view-patch-highlight)
#+END_SRC

* Using the old mu4e-view

For users that set =mu4e-view-use-old= to non-nil, they might also want to get
the =mu4e= faces, too. For that, the following code might be helpful,

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'mu4e)
(require 'message-view-patch)

(add-hook 'mu4e-view-mode-hook #'message-view-patch-highlight)

(setq mu4e-view-use-old t
      message-view-patch-pseudo-headers
      '(("^Acked-by: "      'mu4e-header-key-face 'mu4e-header-value-face)
        ("^C\\(c\\|C\\): "  'mu4e-header-key-face 'mu4e-header-value-face)
